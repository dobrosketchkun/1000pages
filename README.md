Some time ago, a friend shared with me the following screenshots, which claim that if you rewrite by hand the text of people who understand how to compose great prose, the level of your writing will noticeably improve.

As a person living in the information age, I don't believe that this works only with writing on paper. I myself write on paper from time to time, but I'm sure that for many people who live in an urbanized world, the main tools for writing are the keyboard and the smartphone screen.

To be able to test this theory without having to run back and forth with my eyes and constantly manually drag around text I created this project.

After opening the page in your browser, just drag and drop the txt file into the window and the loaded text will appear on the screen in gray. On top of this gray text, the user can type in black. This combination does not put too much pressure on the eyes and allows you to quickly identify a typo. The user can also save the current state to a JSON file to avoid having to start from the beginning again each time. The state is loaded the same way as a txt file - by dragging and dropping it onto the page. For fans of dark themes, this option has been also added.

I provide the [Alice in Wonderland](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dobrosketchkun/1000pages/main/misc/alice_example_state.json) json file as an example of a state to load.
